## Manage NAT instance
This feature is available only in the Pyeongchon region, Korea.

### Create instance
Select an image to use for NAT instance. The rest of the settings is no different from normal instance settings. However, only one interface can be selected. Connect a floating IP to the instance created. NAT instance without a floating IP connected can still access internet using internet gateway, but this method is not recommended.

### Source/target check setting
For the NAT instance to work normally, the option of checking network source/target must be disabled in the Network Interface settings.

### Routing setting
Specifies the NAT instance as a route gateway. The packets delivered to the NAT instance are delivered according to the routing setting of the routing table connected to the subnet of NAT instance.

### Caution on settings
* Do not add a routing setting that specifies the NAT instance as a gateway in the routing table connected to the subnet of the NAT instance. 
* It is strongly recommended to separate the NAT instance subnet from the subnet of an instance that is going to use the NAT instance as a gateway and use a different routing table.
* If the NAT instance subnet and the subnet of an instance that is going to use the NAT instance as a gateway are the same or they are connected to the same routing table, and you have to add a routing setting that specifies the NAT instance as a gateway, then a floating IP must be set for the NAT instance. Also, the target CIDR must be set to IP Prefix 0 (/0). Any other settings will only cause the communication to fail, and might impact the communication of all instances that use the routing table.
> [Note] Routing setting for NAT instance
> * If the subnet of NAT instance is connected to Routing Table 1 and the instances that are going to use the NAT instance as a gateway are connected to Routing Table 2
>  * In the routing setting of Routing Table 2, the NAT instance can be specified as a gateway for a specific CIDR (e.g. 8.8.8.8/32).
>  * You should specify the NAT instance as a gateway in the route setting of Routing Table 1 except in the case of the NAT instance connected to a floating IP, in which case IP prefix 0 (/0) can be set for the target CIDR.
> * If the NAT instance subnet and the subnet of instances that are going to use the NAT instance as a gateway are both connected to Routing Table 1
>  * If NAT instance is connected to a floating IP, IP Prefix 0 (/0) can be set for the target CIDR to route.
>  * Without using the above settings, you should not specify the NAT instance as a gateway in the routing setting of Routing Table 1.
